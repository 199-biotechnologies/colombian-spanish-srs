A: Perdón por llegar tarde. B: Tranqui no hay lío.,A: Sorry for being late. B: No worries no problem.,"Colombian politeness: softening apologies and responses. ""Tranqui"" (from ""tranquilo"") is extremely common in Colombian Spanish to reassure someone. ""No hay lío"" = no problem/no trouble. This adjacency pair shows typical Colombian indirectness and relationship maintenance.

Formality: Informal (friends, colleagues, casual acquaintances)

Regional: Used throughout Colombia, especially urban areas. ""Tranqui"" is more Colombian than other Spanish-speaking countries.

Example: ""Perdón por llegar tarde, el tráfico estaba terrible. B: Tranqui no hay lío, yo también acabo de llegar."" = Sorry for being late, traffic was terrible. B: No worries no problem, I just got here too.

Cultural note: Colombians value punctuality but are understanding about delays due to traffic and transportation issues. The softening response maintains harmony and shows empathy."

Example: ""¿Cómo estás? B: Bien ¿y tú? A: Todo bien, gracias a Dios."" = How are you? B: Good and you? A: All good, thank God.

Cultural note: This is often just a greeting ritual, not always an actual inquiry into wellbeing. Expected response is usually ""bien"" regardless of actual state.

A: ¿Me prestas plata? B: No tengo perdón.,A: Can you lend me money? B: I don't have any sorry.,"Classic request-refuse adjacency pair. Note the Colombian softening with ""perdón"" at the end. ""Plata"" is the Colombian word for money (not ""dinero"" in casual speech).

Formality: Informal (requires established relationship to ask for money)

Regional: ""Plata"" is universal Colombian Spanish. Some countries prefer ""dinero"" but Colombians say ""plata"" in everyday speech.

Example: ""¿Me prestas plata para el taxi? B: No tengo perdón, también ando sin efectivo."" = Can you lend me taxi money? B: I don't have any sorry, I'm also without cash.

Cultural note: Borrowing small amounts between friends is common and acceptable. The apology ""perdón"" softens the refusal and maintains the relationship.
