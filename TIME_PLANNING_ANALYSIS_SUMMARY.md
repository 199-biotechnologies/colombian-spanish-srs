# TIME & PLANNING ANALYSIS - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

## One-Page Overview

## THE VERDICT

**Current Authenticity**: 6.5/10
**With Additions**: 9/10
**Cards Needed**: 50 cards
**Time Investment**: ~5 hours total
**Impact**: Transform from textbook to Colombian street-level fluency

---

## THE BIG 3 CRITICAL GAPS

### 1. CUADRAR - The Planning Verb ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Status**: Completely missing
**Impact**: Sounds like a textbook, not a Colombian
**Solution**: Add 8 cards

Colombians don't "hacer planes" or "planificar" - they **CUADRAR**.

### 2. RATICO - The Time Word ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Status**: Only 2 cards (severely under-represented)
**Impact**: Time references sound formal
**Solution**: Add 6 cards

"Ratico" is everywhere in Colombian speech. You need it.

### 3. CANCELING - The Missing Function ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Status**: Zero cards for canceling/postponing
**Impact**: Cannot back out of plans politely
**Solution**: Add 6 cards

Literal social function is missing.

## WHAT'S WORKING

‚úÖ "Ya" expressions (ya voy, ya casi, ya llegu√©) - EXCELLENT
‚úÖ "Me sirve / Te queda bien" patterns - STRONG
‚úÖ "Ahorita" presence - GOOD
‚úÖ "De una" - Colombian specific ‚ú®
‚úÖ "Me toca" - Colombian specific ‚ú®

---

## WHAT'S MISSING

‚ùå "Cuadrar" (most natural planning verb)
‚ùå "Ratico" variations (super common)
‚ùå Canceling expressions (can't back out)
‚ùå Vague time ("tipo", "por ah√≠")
‚ùå Late-culture reality ("voy saliendo")
‚ùå Urgency markers ("ya ya ya")

---

## THE AUTHENTICITY GAP

### Current State:
You can schedule formal meetings but sound like a calendar app.

### Needed State:
You can make plans like a Colombian - vague timing, flexible commitments, culturally-appropriate lateness.

### The Fix:
20 cards (Phase 1) ‚Üí 8/10 authenticity
50 cards (All phases) ‚Üí 9/10 authenticity

---

## IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

### PHASE 1: Essential (DO TODAY)
- 8 "cuadrar" cards
- 6 "ratico" cards
- 6 canceling cards
**Time**: 90 minutes
**Result**: 6.5 ‚Üí 8.0 authenticity

### PHASE 2: Important (DO THIS WEEK)
- 6 vague time cards
- 6 running late cards
- 4 urgency cards
**Time**: 90 minutes
**Result**: 8.0 ‚Üí 8.5 authenticity

### PHASE 3: Polish (DO SOON)
- 6 waiting cards
- 4 confirmation cards
- 4 additional cards
**Time**: 90 minutes
**Result**: 8.5 ‚Üí 9.0 authenticity

## BEFORE & AFTER IN ONE CONVERSATION

### BEFORE
```
Friend: "¬øCuadramos ma√±ana tipo 3?"
You: [Can't say "cuadramos"]
You: [Can't say "tipo 3"]
You: "¬øMe queda bien ma√±ana a las tres?" ‚ùå
```

### AFTER
```
Friend: "¬øCuadramos ma√±ana tipo 3?"
You: "Me cuadra. Ah√≠ nos vemos." ‚úÖ
```

**See the difference?**

---

## KEY TRANSFORMATIONS

1. **Planear ‚Üí Cuadrar** (planning verb)
2. **Exact time ‚Üí Tipo/Como** (approximate)
3. **"I'm leaving" ‚Üí "Voy saliendo"** (still at home)
4. **Silence ‚Üí "No voy a poder"** (can cancel)
5. **"Ahora" ‚Üí "Ahorita" vs "Ya ya ya"** (urgency levels)

---

## CULTURAL INSIGHTS CAPTURED

### Colombian Time Reality:
- "Ahorita" = anywhere from now to never
- "Voy saliendo" = haven't left yet
- "Dame 10 minutos" = 20 minutes
- "Tipo 3" = between 2:45 and 3:30
- Being 15 mins late = normal

### Your Cards Will Teach:
‚úÖ How to make vague plans
‚úÖ How to run late appropriately
‚úÖ How to cancel politely
‚úÖ How to distinguish urgency
‚úÖ How to speak the time code
