## Sample Enhanced Cards

### Example 1: Grammar Frame
**Spanish:** `{{Acabar}} de + inf: Acabo de comer.`

**Enhanced Notes:**
```
Recent past pattern

Cultural Context: 'Acabar de + infinitive' expresses recent past actions - 'to have just done something'. Essential pattern in Colombian Spanish.

Example 1: Acabo de llegar. = I just arrived.
Example 2: Acabamos de comer. = We just ate.
Example 3: Â¿Ya comiste? - SÃ­, acabo de comer. = Did you eat? - Yes, I just ate.

Formality: Neutral
Usage Notes: Pattern: acabar (conjugated) + de + infinitive. Very common in Colombian Spanish to indicate very recent actions.
```

### Example 2: Cultural Expression
**Spanish:** `Vamos por unas onces`

**Enhanced Notes:**
```
afternoon snack time (CO)

Cultural Context: 'Onces' is a uniquely Colombian tradition - afternoon snack/tea time around 4-5pm. The term comes from British 'elevenses' but moved to afternoon in Colombia.

Example 1: A las 4, Â¿vamos por unas onces? = At 4, shall we go for afternoon snack?
Example 2: Vamos por unas onces al cafÃ© de la esquina. = Let's go for 'onces' at the corner cafÃ©.
Example 3: Invito las onces hoy. = I'm buying the afternoon snack today.

Formality: Informal to Neutral
Usage Notes: 'Onces' typically includes coffee/hot chocolate with bread, cheese, or pastries. Integral part of Colombian social culture. NOT used in other Spanish-speaking countries.
```

### Example 3: Safety Culture
**Spanish:** `AvÃ­same cuando llegues`

**Enhanced Notes:**
```
safety check-in

Cultural Context: Colombian safety culture phrase - family members and friends commonly ask to be notified upon arrival to confirm safety.

Example 1: AvÃ­same cuando llegues a la casa. = Let me know when you get home.
Example 2: AvÃ­same cuando llegues, para estar tranquila. = Let me know when you arrive, so I can be calm.
Example 3: Dale, te aviso cuando llegue. = Okay, I'll let you know when I arrive.

Formality: Neutral
Usage Notes: Reflects Colombian culture of family care and safety concerns. Expected especially when traveling at night or to unfamiliar places. Common via WhatsApp.
