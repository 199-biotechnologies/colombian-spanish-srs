# TIME & PLANNING: TOP PRIORITIES

## Quick Action List

### THE BIG 3 MISSING PIECES

#### 1. CUADRAR (Essential Colombian Verb) ⭐⭐⭐
Colombians don't "hacer planes" or "planificar" - they CUADRAR plans.

**Add these 8 cards immediately**:
```
¿Cuadramos algo? | Should we arrange something?
Te cuadra mañana? | Does tomorrow work for you?
Ya cuadramos | We already arranged it
No me cuadró | It didn't work out for me
Cuadremos bien | Let's arrange it properly
Cuadra con tu horario? | Does it fit with your schedule?
Ahí cuadramos | We'll arrange it then
Está cuadrado | It's all set
```

#### 2. RATICO (Super Common Time Word) ⭐⭐⭐
Only 2 cards use "rato". Need way more - it's everywhere in Colombian speech.

**Add these 6 cards**:
```
En un ratico | In a bit
Dame un ratico | Give me a moment
Al ratico nos vemos | See you in a bit
Un ratito más | A little bit more
Hace rato que estoy esperando | I've been waiting for a while
Nos echamos un rato? | Should we hang out for a bit?
```

#### 3. CANCELING/POSTPONING (Completely Missing) ⭐⭐⭐
You literally cannot cancel plans with current cards.

**Add these 6 cards**:
```
No voy a poder | I won't be able to make it
Se me complicó | It got complicated for me
Mejor otro día | Better another day
Será para la próxima | It'll be for next time
Se me atravesó algo | Something came up
Toca cancelar | We have to cancel
```

## THE COLOMBIAN TIME CULTURE GAP

### Issue: "Ahorita" Means 5 Different Things
**Current cards** translate "ahorita" as "right now" - but in Colombia it means:
- Right now (5 minutes) - rare
- In a bit (30 minutes) - common
- Soon (1 hour) - very common
- Eventually (3+ hours) - common
- Maybe never - possible

**Fix**: Add note to all "ahorita" cards explaining this ambiguity

### Issue: Vague Time is Normal (Missing)
Colombians use approximate time constantly - your cards are too specific.

**Add these 6 cards**:
```
Tipo 5 de la tarde | Like 5pm-ish
Como a las tres | Around three-ish
Por ahí nos vemos | We'll see each other around then
Entre 2 y 3 | Between 2 and 3
En la tarde te llamo | I'll call you in the afternoon
Ahí miramos | We'll see about that
```

### Issue: "Voy saliendo" ≠ "I'm leaving"
Colombian running-late expressions don't match their literal meaning.

**Add these 5 cards**:
```
Voy saliendo | I'm leaving now [note: probably hasn't left]
Voy llegando | I'm arriving [note: still 10-15 mins away]
Estoy cerquita | I'm close by [note: anywhere within 20 mins]
Dame 10 minutos | Give me 10 minutes [note: usually 20]
Me cogió el tráfico | Traffic caught me [note: common excuse]
```

## QUICK WINS (Easy Fixes)

### 1. Add "Cuadrar" Alternatives to Existing Cards
**Current card**: "Te parece si lo planificamos bien"
**Add alternative**: "Cuadremos bien"

### 2. Add Context Notes to "Se me hizo tarde"
**Current**: Just translation
**Add note**: "Common in Colombian culture where being 10-30 mins late is normal"

### 3. Expand "Ya voy"
**Current card**: "Ya voy" = "I'm coming now"
**Add note**: "Often said when you haven't actually left yet"

---

## WHY THESE MATTER

**Without "cuadrar"**: You sound like a textbook, not a Colombian
**Without "ratico"**: Your timing sounds formal and foreign
**Without canceling**: You literally can't back out of plans politely
**Without vague time**: You sound rigid in a flexible-time culture
**Without late-culture**: You'll misunderstand when people say "ahorita"

---

## IMPLEMENTATION ORDER

### TODAY (30 minutes):
1. Add 8 "cuadrar" cards
2. Add 6 "ratico" cards
3. Add 6 canceling cards
**Total**: 20 cards = massive improvement

### THIS WEEK (1 hour):
4. Add 6 vague time cards
5. Add 5 running-late reality cards
6. Add notes to existing "ahorita" cards
**Total**: +11 cards + improved context

### RESULT:
From 6.5/10 authenticity → 8.5/10 authenticity
From "workable" → "sounds Colombian"

## SAMPLE CONVERSATION (Before vs After)

### BEFORE (What you can say now):
```
Person: "¿Nos vemos mañana?"
You: "Me sirve. ¿A qué hora te queda bien?"
Person: "Como a las 3"
You: [No way to say "around 3 works" or confirm]
Person: "No voy a poder"
You: [No way to respond naturally]
```

### AFTER (With new cards):
```
Person: "¿Nos vemos mañana?"
You: "Me cuadra. ¿Tipo qué hora?"
Person: "Como a las 3"
You: "Listo, ya quedamos así. Me avisas si algo"
Person: "No voy a poder, se me complicó"
You: "Tranqui, será para la próxima"
```

See the difference? Native flow vs. textbook rigidity.

## BOTTOM LINE

**Current state**: You can schedule formal meetings
**Needed state**: You can make plans like a Colombian

**The fix**: 20 cards (1 hour of work)
**The payoff**: Sound natural in one of the most common daily interactions

Do it.
