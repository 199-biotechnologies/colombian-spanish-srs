## Implementation Notes

1. **Conversation Flow split should be done FIRST** - it's the biggest issue
2. **Questions & Curiosity and Problems & Solutions** are high-value additions (core skills)
3. **Street & Intimate** should be added with care and cultural context
4. **Feelings & Opinions** needs rebalancing away from romance-only focus
5. All new cards should follow existing tagging conventions for proper categorization
