## INCOMPLETE TRANSLATION FIXES

### 1. Descansar es seguir la rumba

**Current Translation:** `Party...`
**FIXED Translation:** `To rest is to keep the party going`

**Cultural Context:**
- **Register:** Informal, playful slang
- **Vulgarity Level:** MILD - Completely safe
- **Region:** Universal Colombian, especially Medellín/Paisa culture
- **Usage:** Ironic/humorous expression used when someone suggests "resting" after a night out but actually means continuing to party

**Complete Meaning:**
This is a classic Colombian party expression that humorously suggests that the best way to "rest" is to just keep partying. It's the Colombian equivalent of "the night is young" or "let's keep this going."

**Example Sentences:**
- "¿Ya nos vamos?" "No parce, descansar es seguir la rumba" → "Shall we go?" "No dude, the best rest is to keep partying"
- "Estoy cansado pero descansar es seguir la rumba, ¡vamos!" → "I'm tired but rest is for the weak, let's keep going!"

**Usage Notes:** Typically said with a smile, often after a long night of partying when someone suggests going home. Shows the Colombian love for socializing and nightlife.

### 2. Parce suave

**Current Translation:** `[buddy...]`
**FIXED Translation:** `Easy buddy / Relax dude / Chill bro`

**Cultural Context:**
- **Register:** Very informal street slang
- **Vulgarity Level:** MILD - Completely safe
- **Region:** Universal Colombian, especially Antioquia (Medellín)
- **Usage:** Used to calm someone down, tell them to relax, or slow their roll

**Complete Meaning:**
"Parce" = buddy/dude (from "parcero/a"), "suave" = easy/smooth/gentle. Combined, this is telling your friend to take it easy, calm down, or not to worry.

**Example Sentences:**
- "¡Está muy caro!" "Parce suave, yo pago" → "It's too expensive!" "Easy bro, I got it"
- "Parce suave, no es para tanto" → "Chill dude, it's not that serious"
- "Estoy muy estresado" "Parce suave, todo va a estar bien" → "I'm so stressed" "Easy buddy, everything will be fine"

**Usage Notes:** Can be used to calm anxious friends, tell someone to slow down, or reassure someone. Very common in everyday Colombian conversation.

### 3. Parceroparcera

**Current Translation:** `[buddy...]`
**FIXED Translation:** `Buddy / Partner / My friend (gender-neutral or specific)`

**Cultural Context:**
- **Register:** Informal/casual slang
- **Vulgarity Level:** MILD - Completely safe
- **Region:** Universal Colombian, originated in Antioquia
- **Usage:** Term of endearment for friends, the full form of "parce"

**Complete Meaning:**
"Parcero" (male) / "Parcera" (female) is the full word that "parce" comes from. It means buddy, pal, partner, or close friend. Originally Paisa slang but now used throughout Colombia.

**Example Sentences:**
- "Ese es mi parcero desde el colegio" → "He's been my buddy since high school"
- "Ella es mi parcera, confío en ella" → "She's my girl, I trust her"
- "¿Qué hubo parcero?" → "What's up buddy?"
- "Mis parceros me acompañan siempre" → "My buddies always have my back"

**Usage Notes:** More emphatic than just "parce" - shows deeper friendship. Can be used for both genders (parcero/parcera) or generically as "mis parceros" for a group.

### 4. Quiubo parce

**Current Translation:** `[buddy...]`
**FIXED Translation:** `What's up buddy / Hey dude / Yo bro`

**Cultural Context:**
- **Register:** Very informal street slang
- **Vulgarity Level:** MILD - Completely safe
- **Region:** Universal Colombian
- **Usage:** Common casual greeting among friends

**Complete Meaning:**
"Quiubo" is a contraction of "Qué hubo" (literally "what was there" but means "what's up"). Combined with "parce" (buddy), this is a super casual greeting.

**Example Sentences:**
- "Quiubo parce, ¿todo bien?" → "What's up dude, all good?"
- "Quiubo parce, ¿pa' dónde vas?" → "Hey buddy, where you headed?"
- "Quiubo parce, no te había visto" → "Yo bro, haven't seen you around"

**Usage Notes:** Used between male friends primarily, though can be used with close female friends too. Very casual - don't use with elders or formal situations. The ultimate Colombian "bro greeting."

### 5. Qué pena llego tarde

**Current Translation:** `[I'm sorry / how embarrassing...]`
**FIXED Translation:** `I'm so sorry I'm late / How embarrassing, I'm late`

**Cultural Context:**
- **Register:** Polite informal
- **Vulgarity Level:** NONE - Polite expression
- **Region:** Universal Colombian
- **Usage:** Apologizing for being late or causing inconvenience

**Complete Meaning:**
"Qué pena" is a uniquely Colombian expression that literally means "what shame/embarrassment" but is used as "I'm sorry" or "excuse me." It's softer and more humble than "perdón" (sorry).

**Example Sentences:**
- "Qué pena llego tarde, había mucho trancón" → "I'm so sorry I'm late, there was heavy traffic"
- "Qué pena llego tarde, se me pegaron las cobijas" → "Sorry I'm late, I overslept (the blankets stuck to me)"

**Usage Notes:** "Qué pena" is distinctly Colombian. Other Spanish speakers might say "perdón" or "lo siento," but Colombians use "qué pena" constantly - it shows humility and politeness. Can be used for any inconvenience, not just being late.

---

### 6. Qué pena no entendí

**Current Translation:** `[I'm sorry / how embarrassing...]`
**FIXED Translation:** `I'm sorry, I didn't understand / Excuse me, I didn't catch that`

**Cultural Context:**
- **Register:** Polite informal
- **Vulgarity Level:** NONE - Polite expression
- **Region:** Universal Colombian
- **Usage:** Apologizing for not understanding something

**Complete Meaning:**
Using "qué pena" to apologize for not understanding shows Colombian politeness and humility. It's a softer way to ask someone to repeat or explain.

**Example Sentences:**
- "Qué pena no entendí, ¿podés repetir?" → "Sorry I didn't understand, can you repeat?"
- "Qué pena no entendí bien, ¿cómo se dice?" → "Excuse me, I didn't quite get it, how do you say it?"
- "Qué pena no entendí tu mensaje" → "Sorry, I didn't understand your message"

**Usage Notes:** Very useful for language learners! Shows you're being polite while asking for clarification. Colombians appreciate this humility much more than directly saying "no entiendo" (I don't understand).

### 7. Qué significa boletachimbarecocha

**Current Translation:** `[awesome...]`
**FIXED Translation:** `What does awesome/cool/badass mean?` (asking about slang)

**Cultural Context:**
- **Register:** Informal slang
- **Vulgarity Level:** MILD to MODERATE (depending on which word)
- **Region:** Various Colombian regions
- **Usage:** Asking about Colombian slang terms for "awesome"

**Complete Meaning:**
This is actually asking "What does 'boleta/chimba/recocha' mean?" - These are different Colombian slang words:
- **Boleta** = embarrassing, awkward (NOT awesome - possible error in original)
- **Chimba** = awesome, cool, amazing (Paisa/universal)
- **Recocha** = fun, party, good time (coastal/universal)

**Example Sentences:**
- "¿Qué significa 'chimba'?" "Es como decir 'genial' o 'bacano'" → "What does chimba mean?" "It's like saying awesome or cool"
- "¿Qué significa 'recocha'?" "Significa diversión, fiesta" → "What does recocha mean?" "It means fun, party"
- "Esa película fue una chimba" → "That movie was awesome"

**Usage Notes:** This card seems to be teaching someone to ask about Colombian slang. Note: "boleta" actually means embarrassing/awkward, not awesome. Example: "Qué boleta" = "How embarrassing!"

**⚠️ WARNING:** There may be an error in the original Spanish - "boleta" doesn't mean awesome. Consider reviewing this card.

**FIXED Translation:** `If you feel bad, let me know right away / If you're not feeling well, tell me immediately`

**Cultural Context:**
- **Register:** Informal, caring
- **Vulgarity Level:** NONE - Neutral expression
- **Region:** Universal Colombian
- **Usage:** Showing concern, offering immediate help

**Complete Meaning:**
"De una" literally means "of one" but is Colombian slang for "right away," "immediately," or "for sure." Here it means "let me know immediately/right away."

### 9. Tus ojos son como el café colombiano osc

**Current Translation:** `I eat...`
**FIXED Translation:** `Your eyes are like Colombian coffee - dark and I can't get enough`

**Cultural Context:**
- **Register:** Romantic/flirty
- **Vulgarity Level:** NONE - Cheesy pick-up line
- **Region:** Universal Colombian
- **Usage:** Romantic compliment/pick-up line

**Complete Meaning:**
This is a romantic pick-up line comparing someone's eyes to Colombian coffee (which is dark). The full line is likely "Tus ojos son como el café colombiano: oscuros y adictivos" or "oscuros y deliciosos."

**Example Sentences:**
- "Tus ojos son como el café colombiano - oscuros y me tienen despierto toda la noche" → "Your eyes are like Colombian coffee - dark and keep me up all night"
- "Tus ojos son como el café colombiano - no puedo empezar el día sin ellos" → "Your eyes are like Colombian coffee - I can't start my day without them"

**Usage Notes:** Cheesy but charming Colombian pick-up line. Uses cultural pride (Colombian coffee) to flirt. The Spanish appears cut off - "osc" likely is "oscuros" (dark).

**⚠️ POSSIBLE ERROR:** The English "I eat..." doesn't match the Spanish at all. This needs correction.
