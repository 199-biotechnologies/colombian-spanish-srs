- **Back:** You're so hot / You look delicious / You're smoking hot (feminine, sexual/objectifying)
- **Notes:** üî• SEXUAL/FLIRTATIOUS. ‚ö†Ô∏è CAN BE HARASSMENT. Diminutive 'rica' ‚Üí 'ricorica' makes it more playful but STILL sexual/objectifying. Used only for women/femmes. 'Rico/rica' = delicious/tasty applied to people = sexual attraction. From strangers on street = CATCALLING/HARASSMENT.
- **Formality Level:** Very informal/street - sexual

- Level: 3

### Card 7: Line 620 - "Marica" ‚ö†Ô∏è PROBLEMATIC

**CURRENT STATE:**
- Front: Marica
- Back: [Marica]  ‚ö†Ô∏è NOT TRANSLATED
- Notes: [EMPTY]
- Tags: general
- Level: 3

**ENHANCED VERSION:**
- **Back:** Dude / Bro / Man / Homie (Colombian filler word, BUT literally means 'gay/f*ggot')
- **Notes:** üî•‚ö†Ô∏è EXTREMELY COMPLEX WORD - USE WITH CAUTION. Literal meaning: 'gay man' or 'f*ggot' (HOMOPHOBIC SLUR). However, Colombians (especially Paisas) use as casual filler like 'dude/bro'. Can be friendly OR offensive depending on: (1) who says it, (2) tone, (3) context, (4) region. NOT acceptable from foreigners/non-Colombians. Can be highly offensive to LGBTQ+ community even when used casually.
- **Formality Level:** Very informal/street - POTENTIALLY OFFENSIVE
- **When/Where Appropriate:** ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Only use if you're deeply integrated into Colombian culture and understand the nuances. Among very close Colombian friends who use it. NEVER in formal settings. NEVER toward LGBTQ+ individuals unless they use it themselves.
- **Gender Considerations:** Typically used among males, though some women use it too
- **Cultural Context:** ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: This is THE most controversial Colombian slang term. Used constantly in Medell√≠n among friends (even by gay Colombians reclaiming it), but remains homophobic slur in origin. Many Colombians and LGBTQ+ activists fight against its casual use. As a learner/foreigner: OBSERVE but DON'T USE until you fully understand implications. When in doubt, use 'parcero/parcera' instead.

### Card 8: Line 716 - "No joda"

**CURRENT STATE:**
- Front: No joda
- Back: I don't/No...  ‚ö†Ô∏è TRUNCATED
- Notes: [EMPTY]
- Tags: general
- Level: 3

**ENHANCED VERSION:**
- **Back:** Don't fuck around / Don't mess with me / Come on! / Are you serious?! / No way!
- **Notes:** üî• VULGAR but UBIQUITOUS. From 'joder' (to fuck/mess with/annoy). Despite vulgarity, used constantly in Colombia across all ages (except most formal settings). Expresses: annoyance, disbelief, emphasis, frustration, or surprise. Very versatile. Equivalent to English "come on!" or "seriously?!"
- **Formality Level:** Informal/vulgar - but widely accepted
- **When/Where Appropriate:** Everywhere in Colombia except: formal work meetings, speaking to elders you don't know well, academic presentations. Used in: conversations with friends, family (even parents), casual work chat, WhatsApp, showing frustration or disbelief.
- **Gender Considerations:** Gender-neutral, everyone uses it
- **Cultural Context:** One of THE most common Colombian expressions. You'll hear it 50+ times per day in Medell√≠n. Less shocking than English f-word. Conjugates: 'No joda' (don't mess), 'Qu√© joda' (what a pain), 'Est√° jodido' (it's fucked up). Essential for sounding Colombian.

### Card 9: Line 805 - "Qu√© cuerpo tan rico"

**CURRENT STATE:**
- Front: Qu√© cuerpo tan rico
- Back: What...  ‚ö†Ô∏è TRUNCATED
- Notes: [EMPTY]

- Level: 3

**ENHANCED VERSION:**
- **Back:** What a hot body / What a delicious body / What a sexy body
- **Notes:** üî• SEXUAL/OBJECTIFYING. Direct comment on someone's physical attractiveness/body. 'Rico' (delicious/tasty) applied to body = sexual appreciation. Can be flattering between established partners OR harassment from strangers/acquaintances. Highly objectifying.
- **Formality Level:** Informal/sexual - objectifying
- **When/Where Appropriate:** ONLY appropriate with intimate romantic partner in private. Expressing attraction/desire. NEVER to strangers, coworkers, acquaintances. From strangers = street harassment.
- **Gender Considerations:** Can be used about any gender, but most commonly directed at women (and most problematic in that context due to machismo culture)
- **Cultural Context:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Part of Colombian 'piropo' (compliment/catcall) culture. While some see as flattering, it's objectifying. Colombian women deal with constant body commentary on streets. As foreigner: avoid unless with committed partner in private. Not romantic - it's objectifying.

### Card 10: Line 1016 - "Te deseo" ‚úì Already tagged 'intimate'

**CURRENT STATE:**

- Level: 5

**ENHANCED VERSION:**
- **Back:** I desire you / I want you (sexually) / I lust for you

**ENHANCED VERSION:**
- **Back:** Come to bed (sexual invitation) / Come to the bedroom

The Street & Intimate category currently has **only 2 cards properly tagged**, but analysis reveals **11 cards belong in this category**.

**All 11 cards require significant enhancement** with:
- Cultural context explaining Colombian street culture
- Clear formality/vulgarity levels
- Explicit guidance on when/where/with whom to use
- Gender-specific considerations
- Warnings about potential for harassment or offense

**Special attention needed** for 3 cards that involve:

- Potential for causing offense if misused

This category is **critical for learners** as misusing these expressions can:
- Cause serious offense
- Constitute sexual harassment
- Damage relationships
- Create dangerous situations

**All enhancements should prioritize learner safety and cultural sensitivity while still teaching authentic Colombian Spanish.**
